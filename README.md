# ðŸ”° JavaScript Basics Practice

Welcome to my **JavaScript Basics Repository**!  
Here, Iâ€™ve written and practiced small but powerful programs that help in understanding the **core concepts of JavaScript** like Arrays, Strings, Loops, and Methods like `filter()` and `map()`.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### âœ… Arrays & Their Methods
- Creating and accessing arrays
- `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`
- `map()`, `filter()`, `forEach()`
- Finding smallest or largest number
- Sorting elements

### âœ… Strings & Their Methods
- String declaration and concatenation
- Reversing a string
- `length`, `charAt()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`

### âœ… Loops
- `for`, `while`, `do...while` loops
- Looping through arrays and strings
- Basic logic building with loops
